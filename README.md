# 🧬 Genetic Algorithm for Image Reconstruction in Python 🎨🖼️🐍

This project takes advantage of the power of genetic algorithms to reconstruct or approximate a given image. Perfect for those who appreciate the beauty of both art and algorithms.

## 📖 Description 

In this project, we utilize genetic algorithms, which is an optimization technique inspired by natural evolution, to reconstruct images. The individuals in the population of the genetic algorithm are potential solutions to the image reconstruction task. Through iterations of the algorithm, the solutions evolve and get closer and closer to the target image.

## 🔧 Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- [PIL (Pillow)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
